# Tea and Inequality

## What's this?

This is Starry Monlark's personal website, based on the template [Mizuki](https://github.com/matsuzaka-yuki/Mizuki).

This is the `master` branch, with the posts, customized settings, etc. in it, while the `pages` branch is used for static website hosting.

## Moving to this new site

This new website is under construction, which will take some time.

[The old blog](https://blog.strmnl.top) and its repository [strmnl-blog](https://github.com/StrMnL/strmnl-blog) is still available.
